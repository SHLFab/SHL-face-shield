# SHL-face-shield
An open design for 3d printed protective face shields

It corresponds to both safety regulations and ergonomics while it is optimized for quick 3d printing. 
The design is built on best practices, co-creation with users' feedback, and several prototypes. 
By delivering affordable yet safe design in response to the Coronavirus condition, we are doing our part in supporting the supply chain of non-proprietary protective items.
